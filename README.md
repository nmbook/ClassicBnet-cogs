# Classic Battle.net Feed Cogs

This is meant as a stand-alone application to run under Red to feed Classic Battle.net channels to Discord using the [Classic Battle.net binary protocol as documented by the BNETDocs community](https://bnetdocs.org) and past contributors, such as the defunct Valhalla Legends community.

# Installation

**This source code is provided as-is and is not intended to be installed.** After all, configuration is complex and involves a third-party service known as Valhalla egend's BotNet. Instead, pease use the operating bot on Discord under the name **Battle.net#1688**. Instructions coming soon.

# Credits
